Initially, they might notice that their mailbox looks plain or outdated, which prompts them to seek a solution that aligns with their desire for seasonal decorations. The homeowner's catalyst for action could be a desire to impress guests or neighbors, or simply to express their personality through seasonal themes. They may start by browsing online for decoration ideas or visiting local home improvement stores, but they often find the process tedious and time-consuming.

Chart competitive position Competitor Positioning in Competitive Landscape Value Proposition Do Nothing Option Low value in aesthetics and convenience; homeowners may not change their mailbox decor at all. No effort required, but lacks any seasonal appeal or personalization. Local Home Decor Stores Moderate value; offers seasonal decorations but requires time and effort to shop and select items. Provides a variety of options, but lacks the convenience of delivery and subscription model. Seasonal Decor Subscription Services Moderate to high value; some competitors may offer similar subscription services but lack customization. Convenience of delivery, but may not focus specifically on mailbox aesthetics or upscale branding. DIY Decoration Kits Moderate value; allows for personalization but requires effort and creativity from the homeowner. Offers a hands-on approach, but can be time- consuming and may not yield professional results. High-End Landscaping Services High value; may offer mailbox decoration as part of a broader landscaping service. Comprehensive service, but often at a higher price point and may not focus solely on mailbox decor. Analysis: Positioning: Your mailbox decoration service is positioned in the upper-right corner due to its unique offering of stylish, sophisticated decorations delivered monthly, which directly addresses the homeowner's desire for aesthetics and convenience. The ""do nothing"" option is the main competitor, as it provides no value in terms of seasonal appeal. Core Value: Your core value lies in the combination of convenience (monthly delivery), customization (seasonally appropriate designs), and a focus on upscale aesthetics. This allows you to deliver significantly more value than competitors who may offer similar products but lack the subscription model or the specific focus on mailbox decor.

LTV Inputs to the Worksheet Description of the Input Best Estimate Explanation One-Time Charge(s) $50 This is the estimated initial charge for the first set of mailbox decorations. It includes the cost of materials and design. Estimated Profit Margin on One- Time Charges 60% Assuming the cost to produce the decorations is around $20, the profit margin is calculated as (50- 20)/50 = 60%. Life of the Product 1 year The decorations are seasonal and will need to be replaced every year. % of Customers Who Will Repurchase 80% Given the subscription model and the appeal of seasonal decorations, a high repurchase rate is expected. Recurring Revenue Streams $30/month This is the monthly subscription fee for receiving new decorations. Profit Margin on Recurring Revenue Streams 70% The profit margin is high due to low ongoing costs after the initial setup. Retention Rate for Recurring Revenue Streams After 1st year: 85% <br> After 2nd year: 75% <br> After 3rd year: 65% <br> After 4th year: 55% <br> After 5th year: 50% Retention rates are expected to decline as customers may lose interest over time.

The recurring revenue is estimated at $30/month, leading to $360/year, with a profit margin of 70%, resulting in a profit of $252/year. The retention rates are projected to decline over the years, affecting the cumulative present value of profits. The present value factors are calculated using the formula PV = FV (1 / (1+i)^t), where i is the cost of capital (50%). The LTV is calculated as the cumulative present value of profits over the 5-year period. Interpretation of Estimation Question Answer Explanation What would you round your LTV estimation to? What range do you feel comfortable with? $450 - $500 This range reflects the cumulative present value of profits over 5 years, considering the high cost of capital. Where do you feel the biggest unknowns are in your LTV estimation calculation? Customer retention rates Retention rates can vary significantly based on customer satisfaction and market trends. Does the number seem reasonable? Yes The LTV appears reasonable given the subscription model and the target market's willingness to pay for aesthetics. What are the key drivers of the LTV if you want to increase it? Customer retention, upselling opportunities, and increasing the subscription fee Improving retention rates and offering additional products can significantly enhance LTV. Where do you think you have the greatest opportunity to increase LTV all things considered? Upselling additional decor items By introducing complementary products, the business can increase revenue per customer.

Define MVBP How Your Proposed Minimum Viable Business Product (MVBP) Meets the Three Objectives of an MVBP Objectives How, specifically, does your MVBP meet this objective? Value The MVBP provides value by centralizing project planning, time tracking, and client communications, which streamlines the workflow for consultants. By using AI-based insights, it helps consultants forecast resource needs and project profitability, making their work more efficient and effective. Pay The economic buyer, typically consulting firms or independent consultants, will pay a subscription fee for access to the platform. Based on market research, a competitive price point could be around $99/month, which is reasonable for the value provided in terms of time savings and improved project outcomes. Feedback The MVBP creates a meaningful feedback loop by incorporating user analytics and direct communication channels within the platform. Consultants can provide feedback on features, and the AI can adapt based on usage patterns, ensuring continuous improvement and alignment with user needs. Minimizing Investment and/or Speeding Time to Market – Concierge Opportunities Is there anything that can be concierged in your MVBP to reduce the initial investment required to achieve the above three objectives and/or decrease time to get to market with an MVBP? Time may be even more important than money. Concierge Approach: Initially, the project planning and time tracking features can be managed manually by a small team. For example, consultants can submit their project details and time logs via email, which can then be processed by the team to provide insights and reports. This allows for testing the market demand without heavy upfront investment in software development. AI Insights: Instead of building a fully automated AI system from the start, the team can use existing tools and platforms to analyze data and provide insights. This could involve using third-party analytics tools to gather data on project profitability and resource needs, which can later be integrated into the final product. User Engagement: Early adopters can be engaged through direct interviews and surveys to gather feedback on their needs and preferences, which will inform the development of the final product. This approach allows for rapid iteration based on real user input.
